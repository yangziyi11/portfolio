		<div>Scene 1 - Wonderland
</div>
		<div>In the first scene, I want to show a wonderland to the audience. For the characters, I depict the men as rich and lay-back. So, I wear them beach shorts and sunglasses. Same for the women, I want to emphasize their luxury lifestyle, so I dress them jewerys and red lips. All those characters are hanging around the standardized houses during day time, as if they have vacatioon everyday.</div>
		<div>Teleporter
</div>
		<div>Scene 2 - Farm
</div>
		<div>Scene 3 - Hill
</div>
		<div>For navigation among scenes, I used five teleporters to transfer the audience. To attract audiences' attention, those teleporters are spinning.</div>
		<div>In the second scene, I will give the audience more hints about the truth. I modeled several chicken with their eggs. Audience could find out that the residents there actually gained their life essentials from the eggs. From there, the audience may draw a conclusion that the chicken are just tools. Also, I want to make the chicken appear more mesterious. Thus, I gave them a little bit more abstract form to distinguish it from the chicken in our real life.</div>
		<div>All the secrets are revealed through a sacrifice in the final scene. I made the sacrifice on a hill to add on the rural and mysterious feeling. From the scene, the audience will find out that the chicken are not tools, but "gods" to the residents. They sacrifice their lives to feed the chicken, in return, the chicken will produce luxury goods they need. I designed a tatto for the residents. I hand-draw in paper to make them look more like tatoos. I put an egg in their tatooed eyes, as chicken are their gods, and they may want to tatto an egg as eye ball.</div>
